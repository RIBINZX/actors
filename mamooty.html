        Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail (IPA: [muhɐmːɐd̪ kuʈːi pɐnɐpːɐrɐmbil ismɐjl]; born 7 September 1951), known mononymously by the hypocorism Mammootty (IPA: [mɐmːuːʈːi]), is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Malayalam films. He has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a career spanning five decades, he has acted in over 400 films. He is the recipient of several accolades, including three National Film Awards, seven Kerala State Film Awards, and thirteen Filmfare Awards South. For his contribution to film, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri in 1998.

        Mammootty made his debut in acting through Malayalam film Anubhavangal Paalichakal in 1971. His first leading role was in I. V. Sasi's unreleased film Devalokam (1979). Mammootty's breakthrough came in 1981 when he received the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor for his performance in Ahimsa. Major commercial successes during this time included the 1983 films Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu and Aa Raathri. Following a series of box office failures, the 1987 crime thriller New Delhi improved his commercial prospects. The films that followed through the next decade established Mammootty as one of the leading stars of Malayalam cinema.
        
        The 2000s were a period of critical and commercial success for Mammootty. His performance in the Hindi and English-language bilingual biopic Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (2000) won him the National Film Award for Best Actor, and he won Kerala State Film Awards for Kaazcha (2004) and Paleri Manikyam (2009). He garnered further critical praise for the satire Pranchiyettan & the Saint (2010), drama Varsham (2014), period drama Pathemari and black comedy Unda (2019), and received Filmfare Awards for Best Actor for the first three. His highest-grossing releases include the period action Mamangam and Madhura Raja in 2019, and the action thriller Bheeshma Parvam in 2022.
        
        Mammootty is the chairman of Malayalam Communications, which runs the Malayalam television channels Kairali TV, Kairali News and Kairali We. He is the owner of multiple production ventures, including the distribution-production banner Playhouse and the Mammootty Kampany</p>
